# Etch-a-Sketch 🎨

This is a fully functional Etch-a-Sketch application built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can draw by hovering over the grid squares. The application supports dynamic grid resizing, random coloring.

- Responsive fixed-size drawing area (960px x 960px).
- On first hover, each square is assigned a random RGB color.
- Smooth color transitions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox for layout)
- JavaScript (ES6+ for DOM manipulation and logic)

## 🎯 How It Works

- Clicking the **Grid Size** button prompts the user to enter the number of squares per side (max 100).
- The grid is dynamically generated using JavaScript based on user input.
- On  hover over any square, it is assigned a random RGB color.
- The grid size always maintains the same total area regardless of the number of squares.
